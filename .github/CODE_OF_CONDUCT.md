# openSUSE Community Code of Conduct

The openSUSE Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our community behaves and what we value as members and project to others.
This Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and as deemed necessary.

The Code of Conduct does not seek to restrict speech or penalize non-native speakers of English or any other language.
Instead, the Code of Conduct spells out the kinds of behaviors we, as a community, find to be acceptable and unacceptable.

The Code of Conduct is, in many ways, the outward embodiment of the components of openSUSE.
It is important to assume good faith and remember that many of our contributors may have different backgrounds, which could color their approach in all things.
